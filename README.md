Experimental collaborative editor with high hopes. It attempts to emulate the style of Pixel's private editor, pxStage. The main draw is the ability to edit levels with other people.

It's basically a prototype that got out of control, so it's desperately in need of a rewrite, probably in Cython, C, or Rust.

## Usage
Get sdl2, run gxEdit.py. Requires "Kero Blaster" folder to be in the same folder as the editor.
It uatomatically starts you on 01field1.
Use jkli to move to the other fields. You can drag and drop a pxpack from the kero blaster folder to quick load it.

## Editing
You can use several tools (todo)


## multiplayer
To start, host a server 
make sure not to change it before the other player joins.
Undos not supported.
